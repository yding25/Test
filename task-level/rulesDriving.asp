%n is the number of steps.
step(0..n).

%% 1) Change lane to the left
inlane(L2,I+1) :- changeleft(I), not changeright(I+1), inlane(L1,I), leftof(L2,L1), step(I), I>=0, I<n.
-inlane(L,I+1) :- changeleft(I), not changeright(I+1), inlane(L,I), lane(L), step(I), I>=0, I<n.

%% 2) Change lane to the right
inlane(L2,I+1) :- changeright(I), not changeleft(I+1), inlane(L1,I), leftof(L1,L2), step(I), I>=0, I<n.
-inlane(L,I+1) :- changeright(I), not changeleft(I+1), inlane(L,I), lane(L), step(I), I>=0, I<n.

%% 3) Take a left turn
inlane(L2,I+1) :- turnleft(I), inlane(L1,I), lturn(L1,L2), step(I), I>=0, I<n.
-inlane(L,I+1) :- turnleft(I), inlane(L,I), lane(L), step(I), I>=0, I<n.

%% 4) Take a right turn
inlane(L2,I+1) :- turnright(I), inlane(L1,I), rturn(L1,L2), step(I), I>=0, I<n.
-inlane(L,I+1) :- turnright(I), inlane(L,I), lane(L), step(I), I>=0, I<n.

%% 5) Drive forward
inlane(L2,I+1) :- forward(I), inlane(L1,I), passsignal(L1,L2), step(I), I>=0, I<n.
-inlane(L,I+1) :- forward(I), inlane(L,I), lane(L), step(I), I>=0, I<n.
